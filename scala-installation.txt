Step 1 : JAVA Installation
If you have already installed JAVA, then you can skip this step.
If JAVA is not installed, then please follow below steps in order to install JAVA 1.7

command 1 : sudo apt-get update
command 2 : sudo apt-get install openjdk

Once above commands are executed successfully, then you can run following command for verification.
$java -version
Above command should give you output which might look something like this.

java version "1.7.0_71"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_71-b13)
Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 25.0-b02, mixed mode)

JAVA version may be different based on your installation.

Step 2 : Download Scala Package.
$cd
$wget http://downloads.lightbend.com/scala/2.11.7/scala-2.11.7.tgz

Step 3 : Extract Scala Package
$sudo cp scala-2.11.7.tgz /usr/local
$cd /usr/local
$sudo tar -xvf scala-2.11.7.tgz
$sudo mv scala-2.11.7 scala

Step 4 : Update .bashrc file with following contents

#SCALA VARIABLES START
export SCALA_HOME=/usr/local/scala
export PATH=$PATH:$SCALA_HOME/bin
#SCALA VARIABLES END

$cd
$sudo nano .bashrc
